# Tailwind CSS Styling Issues: Troubleshooting Guide

This repository demonstrates and resolves uncommon issues encountered when working with Tailwind CSS.  Specifically, it addresses problems where Tailwind directives fail to apply correctly to HTML elements.

## Bug Description

The core issue is that Tailwind CSS styles are not being applied as expected.  This can arise from seemingly minor errors, like typos in class names, incorrect import statements, or conflicts between Tailwind's automatically generated CSS and custom CSS rules.

## Reproduction

The `bug.html` file shows a simple example where a typo in a Tailwind class name prevents the correct style from being applied.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.html` file provides a corrected version demonstrating the fix.  Key steps to avoid these issues include:

1. **Double-check class names:** Carefully review all Tailwind class names for typos.
2. **Verify imports:** Ensure you've correctly imported Tailwind CSS into your project.
3. **Inspect CSS conflicts:** If custom CSS overrides Tailwind styles, use specificity rules or adjust the order of your CSS imports to prioritize Tailwind.
4. **Use your browser's developer tools:** Inspect the element in your browser's developer tools to see if Tailwind classes are correctly being applied. The absence of Tailwind's generated classes may indicate a problem with the Tailwind setup itself.
