The solution involves correcting the typo in the class name.  The corrected HTML is as follows:

```html
<div class="bg-blue-500 p-4 text-white">
  This is now correctly blue!
</div>
```

By correcting `bg-blue-50` to `bg-blue-500`, Tailwind correctly identifies and applies the intended style. If the issue persists after correcting typos, ensure your Tailwind configuration is correct and check for potential CSS conflicts.
